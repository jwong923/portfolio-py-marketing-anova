About this project:

A fast-food chain is planning to add a new item to their menu, and they are deciding which promotion campaign to promote the latest products. The chain designs three campaigns and tests the effects of each promotion by assigning one type to each store. In this project, A/B testing with ANOVA is used to determine which advertising works the best. We find that promotions 1 and 3 work better than the second promotion across all the market sizes. Also, there is no difference in the mean of sales generated by the first and third promotions. Thus we recommend these two to the chain to promote their new products in all types of stores.
